This section includes the Information Architecture artifact and a checklist to verify compliance with the evaluation criteria.

## Artifact Overview

This artifact presents a brief overview of the information architecture of the system to be developed.  
It has the following goals:
- Help to identify and describe the user requirements, and raise new ones.  
- Preview and empirically test the user interface of the product to be developed.  
- Enable rapid and interactive improvements to the user interface design.  

The artifact includes two main elements:
1. **Sitemap** – definition of how the information is organized in pages.  
2. **Wireframes** – definition of functionality and content for at least two of the most important pages.

## 3.1 Sitemap

A sitemap is a visual representation of the relationship between the different pages of a website that shows how all the information fits together.  
- Each box represents an individual page.  
- Only the main navigational paths are represented.  
- Pages may be grouped to represent areas of related features (e.g., Administration).  

The MediaLibrary system is organized in four main areas:
- Static Pages (general information about the system).  
- Item Library (explore and access the collection).  
- User Pages (user profiles and owned items).  
- Admin Pages (administration features).

## 3.2 Wireframes

Wireframes describe layout ideas, content, and overall page-level design.  
They define how space is allocated and prioritized, and which features are available.  

For the MediaLibrary system, the wireframes include:
- **Item Details page (UI11)**  
- **User Profile page (UI14)**
