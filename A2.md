# A2: Actors and User Stories – Checklist

### Notes to ask the professor
1. Ask about possible redundancy between Business Rule 04 and the admin user story (Monday).  
2. Ask about ambiguities in the definition of actors.  
3. Ask about TR07.  
4. Ask about login/logout/sign-up and visitor user stories:  
   - In which table should they be placed?  
   - How should their priority be defined?

### 2.3 Supplementary Requirements
This section contains **business rules, technical requirements, and other non-functional requirements** of the project.

#### Business Rules
A business rule defines or constrains one aspect of the business, with the intention of asserting business structure or influencing business behaviour. Business rules often supplement usage or user interface requirements.

**Table 7: MediaLibrary business rules**

#### Technical Requirements
Technical requirements are concerned with the technical aspects that the system must meet, such as performance, reliability, and availability.

> The three most critical technical requirements for the project should be highlighted and justified (using **bold** or placed at the top of the list).

**Table 8: MediaLibrary technical requirements**

#### Restrictions
A restriction on the design limits the degree of freedom in the search for a solution [Ambler04].
