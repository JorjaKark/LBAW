# A4: Conceptual Data Model

The **Conceptual Data Model** identifies and describes the **entities** and **relationships** that are relevant to the database specification.  
It defines the data requirements of the system and serves as a foundation for the logical and physical data models.

---

## 4.1 Overview

At this stage of the project, the focus is on the **database specification**.  
Therefore, the Conceptual Domain Model is simplified to include only **concepts (entities and relationships)** that will be stored in the database.

According to the **LBAW Project Rules**, the project’s complexity should lead to the identification of approximately **10 organizational entities**.

## 4.2 UML Class Diagram

A **UML class diagram** is used to document the model.  
The diagram includes:

- **Classes (Entities)**
- **Associations (Relationships)**
- **Attributes and their domains**
- **Multiplicity of associations**
- **Roles and constraints**

> *Tip:* Start by modeling only the classes and relationships to avoid overloading the diagram too early.  
> In subsequent iterations, gradually add details such as attributes, domains, and constraints.

### Recommended Tools
A professional diagram-drawing tool that supports UML is recommended (e.g., draw.io, Lucidchart, Visual Paradigm, StarUML).

## 4.3 Additional Business Rules

Additional business rules or restrictions that cannot be fully represented in the UML class diagram  
should be described using **UML notes** or in this section.

### Business Rules

| ID | Rule Description |
|----|------------------|
| **BR01** | A user cannot loan their own items. |
| **BR02** | An item can only be loaned by its owner. |
| **BR03** | An item can only be loaned to one user at a time. |
